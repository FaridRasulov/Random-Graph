    "1) For the following task we need to discribe the conmplexity of the following operations. Matrix multiplication is an $O(n^3)$ operation. Since its in a for loop (through n), the final complexity of irreducibility method is $O(n^4)$. There are two main operations required to apply Laplacian matrix/eigenvalue method for connectivity; Laplacian matrix computation and eigenvalue calculation. Laplacian matrix computational time is in $O(n^3)$, however since eigenvalue calculation works in $O(n^3)$, the final complexity of the method is $O(n^3)$. BFS : The complexity of BFS nectedness check is $O(n^2)$. For the three connectivity checking algorithms we obtain the following plots of execution time.\n",
